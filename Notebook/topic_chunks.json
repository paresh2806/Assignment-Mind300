Pay online through your secure Medicare account: Visit Medicare.gov/account/login to log into (or create) your Medicare account. Then, select \"Pay my premium\" to make a payment by credit card, debit card, Health Savings Account (HSA) card, or from your checking or savings account. You'll get a confirmation number when you make your payment. This service is free is and is the fastest way to pay your premium.\n\n2.

Through your bank: Contact your bank to set up a one-time or recurring payment from your checking or savings account. Not all banks offer this service, and some charge a fee. Enter your information carefully to make sure your payment goes through on time. Give the bank this information:\n- Your 11-character Medicare Number: Enter the numbers and letters without dashes, spaces, or extra characters.\n- Payee name: CMS Medicare Insurance\n- Payee address:\nMedicare Premium Collection Center\nPO Box 790355\nSt. Louis, MO 63179-0355\n- The amount of your payment\n\n4. Through the mail: You can pay by check, money order, credit card, debit card, or HSA card. Fill out the payment coupon at the bottom of your bill and include it with your payment. Payments made by mail take longer to process than payments made quickly and securely through your online Medicare account. Use the return envelope that came with your bill, and mail your Medicare payment coupon and payment to:\nMedicare Premium Collection Center\nPO Box 790355\nSt. Louis, MO 63179-0355\n\nIf you have questions about your premiums, call 1-800-MEDICARE or visit Medicare.gov/basics/costs/pay-premiums.\n\nIf you need to change your address on your bill, visit SSA.gov/mycontact.\n\nYou may be able to get help from your state to pay your Part A and Part B premiums through a Medicare Savings Program.

Original Medicare will still pay for covered benefits for any health problems that aren't part of your terminal illness and related conditions, but hospice should cover most of your care.\n\nMedicare won't pay room and board for your care in a facility, unless the hospice medical team decides you need short-term inpatient care to manage pain and other symptoms.

This notice tells you why you're an outpatient (in a hospital or critical access hospital) getting observation services, and how it affects what you pay in the hospital and for care after you leave.\n\n> **New!** You now have appeal rights when a hospital changes your status from inpatient to outpatient if you meet certain criteria.

    "content": "A Medicare Advantage Plan is another way to get your Medicare Part A and Part B coverage. Medicare Advantage Plans, sometimes called \"Part C\" or \"MA Plans,\" are Medicare-approved plans. They're offered by private companies that must follow rules set by Medicare. Most Medicare Advantage Plans include Medicare drug coverage (Part D). In many cases, you'll need to use health care providers who participate in the plan's network. These plans set a limit on what you'll have to pay out of pocket each year for services covered under Part A and Part B. Some plans offer non-emergency coverage out of network, but typically at a higher cost. For certain services or drugs, you may need to get approval (also called prior authorization), from your plan before it covers them. In some cases, you may also need to get a referral to use a specialist.\n\nRemember, you must use the card from your Medicare Advantage Plan to get your Medicare-covered services. Keep your red, white, and blue Medicare card in a safe place because you might need it later.\n\nIf you join a Medicare Advantage Plan, you'll still have Medicare but you'll get most of your Part A and Part B coverage from your plan, not Original Medicare."

The plan can choose not to cover the costs of services that aren't medically necessary under Medicare. In some instances, where Medicare hasn't established coverage criteria, plans may also use their own coverage criteria to determine if certain services are medically necessary.

Call your State Medical Assistance (Medicaid) office to verify your Medicaid eligibility.\n* **Chronic Condition SNP (C-SNP):** People who have specific severe or disabling chronic conditions (like diabetes, End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), HIV/AIDS, chronic heart failure, or dementia). Plans may further limit membership to a single chronic condition or a group of related chronic conditions.\n* **Institutional SNP (I-SNP):** People who live in certain institutions (like nursing homes) or who live in the community but require a high level of nursing care at home.\n\n**New!** If you have Medicare and get full Medicaid benefits, you can join or switch an integrated D-SNP once a calendar month. For more information, Medicare.gov/special-enrollment-periods and select \"I have Medicare and get full Medicaid benefits.\"\n\nWhen you're ready to find and compare SNPs in your area, visit Medicare.gov/plan-compare. You can filter your search results by \"Special Needs Plans (SNP).\""

Because of this, Plans C and F are no longer available to people new to Medicare on or after January 1, 2020. However, if you were eligible for Medicare before January 1, 2020, but haven't yet enrolled, you may be able to buy Plan C or Plan F. While people new to Medicare on or after January 1, 2020, can't buy Plans C and F, they have the right to buy Plans D and G (instead of Plans C and F), which provide the same benefits with the exception of coverage for the Part B deductible.\n\nNote: Go to pages 119\u2013122 for definitions of blue words."

    "content": "Before you can buy Medicare Supplement Insurance (Medigap), you must generally have Part A and Part B. With Medigap, you pay a monthly premium to a private insurance company in addition to the monthly Part B premium you pay to Medicare. If you're thinking about buying Medigap, be sure to compare plans. The costs can vary between plans offered by different companies for exactly the same coverage, and may go up as you get older. Some states limit Medigap premium costs. A Medigap policy only covers one person. Spouses must buy separate coverage.\n\n**Note:** In some states, you may be able to buy another type of Medigap policy called Medicare SELECT. It requires you to use hospitals and, in some cases, doctors within its network to be eligible for full insurance benefits (except in an emergency). If you buy Medicare SELECT, you have rights to change your mind within 12 months and switch to standard Medigap."

This 6-month period begins the first month you have Medicare Part B (Medical Insurance), and you're 65 or older. (Some states have additional Open Enrollment Periods.) After this enrollment period, you may not be able to buy a Medigap policy or it may cost more. In certain situations, you may have rights to buy a Medigap policy (guaranteed issue rights) outside of your Medigap Open Enrollment Period.\n\n- If you delay signing up for Part B because you have group health coverage based on your (or your spouse's) current employment, your Medigap Open Enrollment Period won't start until you get Part B.\n\n- Federal law generally doesn't require insurance companies to sell Medigap to people under 65. If you're under 65, you might not be able to buy the policy you want, or any policy, until you turn 65. However, some states require Medigap insurance companies to sell Medigap policies to people under 65. If you're able to buy one, it may cost more.\n\nCall your State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP) (go to pages 114-117 for the phone number of your local SHIP), or your State Insurance Department to learn more about your rights to buy a Medigap policy.

    "content": "Medicare drug coverage (Part D) helps pay for your prescription drugs. It's optional and offered to everyone with Medicare. Even if you don't take prescription drugs now, consider getting Medicare drug coverage. If you decide not to get it when you're first eligible, and you don't have other creditable prescription drug coverage (like drug coverage from an employer or union) or get Extra Help, you'll likely pay a late enrollment penalty if you join a plan later. Generally, you'll pay this penalty for as long as you have Medicare drug coverage (pages 83-85). To get Medicare drug coverage, you must join a Medicare-approved plan that offers drug coverage. Each plan can vary in cost and specific drugs covered. Visit Medicare.gov/plan-compare to find and compare plans in your area. You can also call your State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP) for help comparing plans. Go to pages 114-117 for the phone number of your local SHIP, or visit shiphelp.org.\n\nThere are 2 ways to get Medicare drug coverage (Part D):\n\n1. Medicare drug plans. These plans add Medicare drug coverage (Part D) to Original Medicare, some Medicare Cost Plans, some Medicare Advantage Private Fee-for-Service Plans, and Medical Savings Account (MSA) Plans. You must have Part A and/or Part B to join a separate Medicare drug plan.\n\n2. Medicare Advantage Plans or other Medicare health plans with drug coverage. You get your Part A, Part B, and Medicare drug coverage (Part D) through these plans. Remember, you must have Part A and Part B to join a Medicare Advantage Plan, and not all Medicare Advantage Plans offer drug coverage.\n\nIn either case, you must live in the service area of the plan you want to join and be lawfully present in the U.S.\n\nMedicare drug plans and Medicare health plans with drug coverage are called \"Medicare drug coverage\" in this handbook.\n\nNote: Go to pages 119-122 for definitions of blue words."

If you're in a Medicare Advantage Plan or a Medicare Cost Plan with drug coverage, the monthly premium may include an amount for drug coverage.\n\nNote: Contact your plan (not Social Security or the Railroad Retirement Board (RRB)) if you want your drug premium deducted from your monthly Social Security or RRB payment.

You'll also have to pay this extra amount if you're in a Medicare Advantage Plan that includes drug coverage. This doesn't affect everyone, so most people won't pay an extra amount.\n\nUsually, Medicare or the RRB will deduct the extra amount from your Social Security or RRB payment.

You may not be able to join another plan right away, and you may have to pay a late enrollment penalty for as long as you have drug coverage.\n\nYou'll pay Part D IRMAA payments separately, even if your employer or another third party (like a retirement system) pays your plan premiums.\n\nIf you have to pay the Part D IRMAA and you disagree (for example, you have one or more life-changing events that lower your income), visit SSA.gov/medicare/lower-irmaa."

    "content": "The cost of the late enrollment penalty depends on how long you didn't have creditable prescription drug coverage. Currently, the late enrollment penalty is calculated by multiplying 1% of the \"national base beneficiary premium\" ($36.78 in 2025) by the number of full, uncovered months that you were eligible but didn't have Medicare drug coverage (Part D) and went without other creditable prescription drug coverage. The final amount is rounded to the nearest $.10 and added to your monthly premium. The \"national base beneficiary premium\" may increase or decrease each year. If that happens, the penalty amount you pay may increase or decrease. After you get Medicare drug coverage, the plan will tell you if you owe a penalty and what your premium will be.\n\n#### Example:\n\nMrs. Martinez is currently eligible for Medicare, and her Initial Enrollment Period ended on July 31, 2021. She doesn't have prescription drug coverage from any other source. She didn't join by July 31, 2021, and instead joined during the Open Enrollment Period that ended December 7, 2023. Her drug coverage was effective January 1, 2024.\n\n**2024**\n\nSince Mrs. Martinez was without creditable prescription drug coverage from August 2021\u2013December 2023, her penalty in 2024 was 29% (1% for each of the 29 months) of $34.70 (the national base beneficiary premium for 2024) or $10.06. Since the monthly penalty is always rounded to the nearest $0.10, she paid $10.10 each month in addition to her plan's monthly premium.\n\n**Here's the math:**\n.29 (29% penalty) \u00d7 $34.70 (2024 base beneficiary premium) = $10.06\n$10.06 rounded to the nearest $0.10 = $10.10\n$10.10 = Mrs. Martinez's monthly late enrollment penalty for 2024"

Before joining a plan, be sure to review its formulary.\n\nA plan can make some changes to its drug list during the year if it follows guidelines set by Medicare. For example, your plan may change its drug list during the year because drug therapies change, new drugs are released, or new medical information becomes available. Your plan coinsurance may increase for a particular brand name drug or generic drug when the manufacturer raises the price. Your copayment or coinsurance may increase when a plan starts to offer a generic version of a brand name drug or biosimilar version of an original biological product, but you continue to take the brand name drug or original biological product. In some cases, the plan may cover a drug for one health condition but not another.\n\nNote: Medicare Part B covers a limited number of outpatient prescription drugs. Go to page 39 for more information. Medicare drug coverage (Part D) includes drugs, like buprenorphine, to treat Opioid Use Disorders. It also covers drugs, like methadone, when prescribed for pain (but not covered under Part D to treat Opioid Use Disorders).\n\nPart D typically places drugs into different levels called \"tiers\" on their formularies.

Opioid pain medicine (like oxycodone and hydrocodone) can help with certain types of pain, but have risks and side effects (like dependence, overdose, and death). These can increase when you take opioids with certain other drugs, like benzodiazepines, anti-seizure medications, gabapentin, muscle relaxers, certain antidepressants, and drugs for sleeping problems. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions about risks or side effects.\n\n- **Drug Management Programs:** Medicare drug coverage (Part D) has programs in place to help you use opioids and benzodiazepines safely. If your opioid use could be unsafe (for example, due to getting opioid prescriptions from multiple doctors or pharmacies, or if you had a recent overdose from opioids), your plan will contact the doctors who prescribed them for you to make sure they're medically necessary and you're using them appropriately."

Many Indian health facilities participate in Medicare drug coverage (Part D). If you get prescription drugs through an Indian health facility, you'll continue to get them at no cost to you, and your coverage won't be interrupted. Joining a Medicare drug plan or Medicare Advantage Plan with drug coverage may help your Indian health facility because the plan pays the Indian health facility for the cost of your prescription drugs. Talk to your local Indian health benefits coordinator who can help you choose a plan that meets your needs and tell you how Medicare works with the Indian health care system.\n\nGo to pages 10\u201314 for an overview of your Medicare options."

In addition, Medicare providers aren't allowed to bill you for services and items Medicare covers, including deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments. If you get a bill for these charges, tell your provider or the debt collector that you're in the QMB Program and can't be charged for Medicare deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments. If you've already made payments on a bill for services and items Medicare covers, you have the right to a refund. If you're in a Medicare Advantage Plan, you should also contact the plan to ask them to stop the charges.\n\nTo make sure your provider knows you're in the QMB Program, show both your Medicare and Medicaid or QMB card each time you get care. If you have Original Medicare, you can also give your provider a copy of your \"Medicare Summary Notice\" (MSN). Your MSN will show you're in the QMB Program and shouldn't be billed. Log into (or create) your secure Medicare account at Medicare.gov to sign up to get your MSNs electronically.\n\nIf your provider won't stop billing you, call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227). TTY users can call 1-877-486-2048. We can also confirm that you're in the QMB Program.\n\n2. **Specified Low-Income Medicare Beneficiary (SLMB):** Covers Part B premium only.\n\n3. **Qualifying Individual (QI):** Covers Part B premium only. QI is only available for people who don't qualify for any other Medicaid coverage or benefits.\n\n4. **Qualified Disabled and Working Individuals (QDWI):** Covers Part A premium only. You may qualify for this program if you have a disability, you're working, and you lost your Social Security disability benefits and premium-free Part A because you returned to work.\n\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid blue; padding: 10px; margin: 10px 0;\">\nIf you sign up for the immunosuppressive drug benefit (page 52) and have limited income and resources, but don't have full Medicaid coverage, you may qualify for help paying the costs through a QMB, SLMB, or QI Program.

    "content": "Medicare continues to look for ways to better coordinate your care and to make sure that you get the best health care possible.\n\nHere are examples of how your health care providers can better coordinate your care:\n\n#### Accountable Care Organizations\n\nAn Accountable Care Organization (ACO) is a group of doctors, hospitals, and other health care providers who accept Original Medicare and work together to coordinate your health care.\n\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #000; padding: 10px; margin: 10px 0;\">\nWorking as part of an ACO helps your doctors and other health care providers understand your health history and talk to one another about your care and your health care needs. This may save you time, money, and frustration by avoiding repeated tests and appointments. More coordination also helps prevent medical errors and unexpected drug interactions that may happen if one provider isn't aware of what another has prescribed you.\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"background-color: #e6f2ff; padding: 10px; margin: 10px 0;\">\n<strong>Important!</strong> An ACO won't limit your choice of health care providers. If your doctor or other provider is part of an ACO, you still have the right to visit any doctor, hospital, or other provider that takes Medicare at any time.\n</div>\n\nIn addition, if your primary care doctor participates in an ACO, you may be able to get more benefits. For example, in some ACOs, your provider may offer more telehealth services. This means you may be able to get some services from home using technology, like your phone or a computer, to communicate in real time with your health care provider.\n\nIn addition, a doctor or other provider who is part of an ACO may be able to send their patients for skilled nursing facility care or rehabilitation services even if they haven't stayed in a hospital for 3 days first, which is usually a requirement in Medicare. For you to qualify for this benefit, your doctor or other provider has to decide that you need skilled nursing facility care and meet certain other eligibility requirements.\n\nIf your primary care doctor participates in an ACO and you have Original Medicare, you'll get a written notice and/or find a poster in their office about their ACO participation. There are now hundreds of ACOs across the country. Visit Medicare.gov/care-compare to find a primary care doctor that's part of an ACO."

    "content": "One of the most important benefits of an ACO is that your doctors and other providers can communicate and coordinate your care. To help with that, Medicare allows your health care provider's ACO to ask for certain information about your care. Having Medicare share your data in this way helps make sure all the people involved in your care have access to your health information when they need it to help you.\n\nIf you don't want Medicare to share your health information with your doctors for care coordination, call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227) and let the representative know. TTY users can call 1-877-486-2048. Medicare may still share general information to measure provider quality.\n\nTo learn more about ACOs, visit Medicare.gov/manage-your-health/coordinating-your-care/accountable-care-organizations or call 1-800-MEDICARE."
