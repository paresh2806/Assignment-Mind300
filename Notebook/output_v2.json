If you’re considering COBRA, there may be reasons why\n                 you should take Part B instead of, or in addition to, COBRA coverage.

In certain types of plans that don't include Medicare drug coverage (like Medical Savings Account Plans and some Private Fee-for-Service Plans), you can join a separate Medicare drug plan. However, if you join a Health Maintenance Organization Plan or Preferred Provider Organization Plan, which doesn't cover drugs, you can't join a separate Medicare drug plan.\n\nIn this case, you'll either need to use other prescription drug coverage you have (like employer or retiree coverage), or go without drug coverage. If you decide not to get Medicare drug coverage when you're first eligible and your other drug coverage isn't creditable prescription drug coverage, you may have to pay a late enrollment penalty (pages 83-85) if you join a Part D plan later.\n\n### What if I have other coverage?\nTalk to your employer, union, or other benefits administrator about their rules before you join a Medicare Advantage Plan. In some cases, joining a Medicare Advantage Plan might cause you to lose your employer or union coverage for yourself, your spouse, and your dependents, and you may not be able to get it back. In other cases, if you join a Medicare Advantage Plan, you may still be able to use your employer or union coverage along with the Medicare Advantage Plan you join. Your employer or union may also offer a Medicare Advantage retiree health plan that they sponsor. You can only be in one Medicare Advantage Plan at a time.","images":[{"name":"page_64.jpg","height":783,"width":603,"x":0,"y":0,"original_width":1232,"original_height":1600,"type":"full_page_screenshot"}],"charts":[],"items":[{"type":"heading","lvl":2,"value":"What should I know about Medicare Advantage Plans?","md":"## What should I know about Medicare Advantage Plans?","bBox":{"x":103.5,"y":58.1,"w":364,"h":13}},{"type":"text","value":"To join a Medicare Advantage Plan, you must:\n* Have Part A and Part B.\n* Live in the plan's service area.\n* Be a U.S. citizen or lawfully present in the U.S.","md":"To join a Medicare Advantage Plan, you must:\n* Have Part A and Part B.\n* Live in the plan's service area.\n* Be a U.S. citizen or lawfully present in the U.S.","bBox":{"x":103.5,"y":75.76,"w":264.5,"h":54.92}},{"type":"heading","lvl":3,"value":"Joining and leaving","md":"### Joining and leaving","bBox":{"x":103.5,"y":142.68,"w":116,"h":11}},{"type":"text","value":"* You can join a Medicare Advantage Plan even if you have a pre-existing condition.\n* You can join or drop a Medicare Advantage Plan only at certain times during the year.

Based on your health needs, you, your representative, or your doctor can ask for a fast decision on your organization determination request. If your plan denies coverage, the plan must tell you in writing, and you have the right to appeal. Go to pages 97-100.\n\nIf a plan provider refers you for a covered service or to a provider outside the network, but doesn't get an organization determination in advance, this is called \"plan directed care.\" In most cases, you won't have to pay more than the plan's usual cost sharing. Check with your plan for more information about this protection.","bBox":{"x":23.4,"y":25.52,"w":510.1,"h":272.83}},{"type":"heading","lvl":2,"value":"Types of Medicare Advantage Plans","md":"## Types of Medicare Advantage Plans","bBox":{"x":103.5,"y":319.35,"w":265,"h":14}},{"type":"heading","lvl":3,"value":"Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) Plan","md":"### Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) Plan","bBox":{"x":103.5,"y":344.35,"w":303,"h":13}},{"type":"text","value":"Can I get my health care from any doctor, other health care provider, or hospital?\nNo. You generally must get your care and services from doctors, other health care providers, or hospitals in the plan's network (except for emergency care, out-of-area urgent care, or temporary out-of-area dialysis, which is covered whether it's provided in the plan's network or outside the plan's network).

With Medigap, you pay a monthly premium\nto a private insurance company in addition to the monthly Part B premium\nyou pay to Medicare. If you're thinking about buying Medigap, be sure to\ncompare plans. The costs can vary between plans offered by different\ncompanies for exactly the same coverage, and may go up as you get older.\nSome states limit Medigap premium costs. A Medigap policy only covers one\nperson. Spouses must buy separate coverage.\n\nNote: In some states, you may be able to buy another type of Medigap policy\ncalled Medicare SELECT. It requires you to use hospitals and, in some cases,\ndoctors within its network to be eligible for full insurance benefits (except in\nan emergency).

Contact the\ncompany to find out how to pay your premiums.\n\nCan I have drug coverage in both Medigap and my Medicare drug plan?\nNo. Go to page 89 for more information.\n\nWhen does a Medigap policy start?\nGenerally, your Medigap policy will begin the first of the month after you\napply, but you can decide when you want it to start.\n\nWhen's the best time to buy a Medigap policy?\n• The best time to buy a Medigap policy is during your Medigap Open\n   Enrollment Period. This 6-month period begins the first month you have\n   Medicare Part B (Medical Insurance), and you’re 65 or older. (Some states\n   have additional Open Enrollment Periods.) After this enrollment period,\n   you may not be able to buy a Medigap policy or it may cost more. In\n   certain situations, you may have rights to buy a Medigap policy (guaranteed\n   issue rights) outside of your Medigap Open Enrollment Period.\n• If you delay signing up for Part B because you have group health coverage\n   based on your (or your spouse’s) current employment, your Medigap Open\n   Enrollment Period won’t start until you get Part B.\n• Federal law generally doesn’t require insurance companies to sell Medigap\n   to people under 65. If you’re under 65, you might not be able to buy the\n   policy you want, or any policy, until you turn 65.

Get Medicare drug coverage (Part D) when you’re first eligible for it. Even\n                 if you don’t take drugs now, you should consider joining a separate Medicare\n                 drug plan or a Medicare Advantage Plan with drug coverage to avoid a\n                 penalty. You may be able to find a plan that meets your needs with little to\n                 no monthly premiums.\n              2. Add Medicare drug coverage (Part D) if you lose other creditable coverage.\n                 Creditable prescription drug coverage could include drug coverage from\n                 a current or former employer or union, TRICARE, Indian Health Service, the\n                 Department of Veterans Affairs, or individual health insurance coverage. Your\n                 plan must tell you each year if your non-Medicare drug coverage is creditable\n                 coverage. If you go 63 days or more in a row without Medicare drug coverage\n                 or other creditable prescription drug coverage, you may have to pay a\n                 penalty if you sign up for Medicare drug coverage later.\n              3. Keep records showing when you had other creditable prescription drug\n                 coverage, and tell your plan when they ask about it. If you don’t tell your\n                 plan about your previous creditable prescription drug coverage, you may\n                 have to pay a penalty for as long as you have Medicare drug coverage.\n\n              How much more will I pay for a late enrollment penalty?\n              The cost of the late enrollment penalty depends on how long you didn’t have\n              creditable prescription drug coverage. Currently, the late enrollment penalty is\n              calculated by multiplying 1% of the “national base beneficiary premium”\n              ($36.78 in 2025) by the number of full, uncovered months that you were\n              eligible but didn’t have Medicare drug coverage (Part D) and went without\n              other creditable prescription drug coverage. The final amount is rounded to\n              the nearest $.10 and added to your monthly premium. The “national base\n              beneficiary premium” may increase or decrease each year. If that happens, the\n              penalty amount you pay may increase or decrease.
